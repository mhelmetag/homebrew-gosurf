# Homebrew Tap

A [Homebrew tap](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Taps.md) for my tools.

## Initial Setup

If you don't have homebrew, install that first.

Then, add this tap:

```sh
$ brew tap mhelmetag/tap
```

## Installing

To install one of my tools (like the Gosurf CLI):

```sh
$ brew install gosurf
```

## Updating

```sh
$ brew update
$ brew upgrade gosurf
```
